## Software Specification
Joke Machine is a joke generation and explanation platform that allows users to generate, search for, save, and understand jokes. Users can generate or search up jokes, ask for explanations, and sort their list of favorite jokes based on rating of the jokes. Joke Machine integrates with external APIs for joke generation and explanation to provide rich and diverse humor content.

## Features
  Joke Generation: Generate new jokes with a variety of themes and styles.
  Joke Explanation: Explain jokes, whether generated by the app or provided by the user.
  Favorites Management: Save favorite jokes to revisit later.
  Search and Filter:
    Search for jokes by title or keywords (e.g., themes like "911").
    Search for jokes within saved list of jokes
    Filter jokes by rating to find the "funniest" jokes.
