    Filter jokes by rating to find the "funniest" jokes.

**User Stories**
  Bob generates a joke. He then keeps generating new jokes with different specifications until he     is tired.
  Bob was told a joke but he doesn't understand it. He runs the joke explanation program and the      program explains to him what is funny about the joke.
  Bob finds some jokes funny and saves them as favorite. He later wants to revisit the jokes that     were favorited, so he revisits his list of saved jokes.
  Bob remembers a joke vaguely, he only remembers that it was about 911. He searches “911”  and a     few different jokes pop up.
  Bob wants to find a specific saved joke, he doesn’t remember what the joke said but he remembers    the explanation. He then goes into his list of saved jokes and searches by keywords in the          explanation.
  Bob wants to find some really funny jokes. He presses the “Funniest” button in the saved view,      then the program returns the joke with the highest score.
