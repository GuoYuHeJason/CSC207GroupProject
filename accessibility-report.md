# Principles of Universal Design: 

### Principle 1: Equitable Use. 
The Joke machine is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities since it does not require much skill beyond basic linguistic abilities. 
The program also does not require personal information such that the userâ€™s privacy, safety or security would be infringed upon by using the program. 

### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use. 
The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences due to the diversity in jokes generated. 

### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use.  
The program is easy to understand, given the user has basic English comprehension skills and does not require any prior knowledge. 
However, the program is not accessible to those who are visually impaired and would need further implementations to overcome this problem. 

### Principle 4: Perceptible Information. 
Unfortunately, the program does not communicate necessary information effectively to users if they have impaired visual sensory abilities. Improvements that allow for auditory based inputs and outputs would need to be implemented. 

### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error. 
The design of the program minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions since the scope of the domain is relatively small. Thus, the program is unlikely to cause any risk to the user. 

### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort.  
The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue since the program does not require much input from the user. The user can simply use the program by clicking various buttons such as generate, save and revisit. 

### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use. 
Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of the user's body size, posture, or mobility. This is because the program does not require the user to be confined in a certain physical environment. The user can simply access the program on a laptop anywhere.

The Joke Machine would be primarily marketed towards individuals who enjoy humor such as comedy enthusiasts, social media users, and casual users who are seeking to learn about some jokes. In particular, the program may be engaging to students or those of a younger age as they may feel more pressure to have a sense of humor amongst their peer group. Furthermore, the explanation feature of the program may be attractive to those you are seeking for guidance in improving their literary skills to enhance their social interactions with their peers. 

Although our program would likely be used for those who are looking for a casual source of entertainment but may be particularly useful for those who lack confidence in their sense of humor and want to seek guidance in interpreting jokes. This may include non-native English speakers who struggle with cultural nuances or linguistic subtleties in humor. Our program also ensures inclusivity to a wide range of users, including those who suffer from physical injuries, such as a broken leg and are unable to walk.
